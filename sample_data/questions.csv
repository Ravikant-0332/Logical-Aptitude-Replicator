"How much does a watch lose or gain per day, if its hands coincide every 65 minutes?","Hands of any accurate clock coincide after every 65 minutes $\frac{5}{11}$ of a minute i.e; ${65\frac{5}{11}}$  
  
Gain in 65 mins = (${65\frac{5}{11}}$ - 65)  
= $\frac{720}{11}$ -$\frac{715}{11}$  
=$\frac{5}{11}$

How many minimum & maximum number of pieces will be obtained when 12 cuts are made on a cube?,"Let us assume n as no. of cuts.
The formula for Min. no. of cubes is = n+1 
The formula for Max. no. if cubes is = (nl+1)*(nb+1)*(nh+1)
Where, nl,nb,nh are no. of cuts along length,breadth and height respectively.

Here n=12, 
So, Min. no. of cubes obtained = 12 + 1 = 13
For, Max pieces, divide n(here 12) in 3 parts(nl,nh,nb) in such a way that the three parts are either equal or consecutive.

As there are 12 edges in a cube, flowers reqd. are 12*2 = 24
Finally we need to add 5 flowers at center of each face of a cube and cube contains 6 faces,

Since the trains are going to meet 30 minutes, which means, the relative speed=30+40 = 70 km/hr.
